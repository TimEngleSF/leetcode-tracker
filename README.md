# LC-Tracker

LC-Tracker is to transform the way coding challenges are approached, making the
journey from a solitary task to an engaging, communal experience. It's a
community-based LeetCode tracking system that prioritizes social learning,
enabling users to connect with fellow coders and share their progress. This
system is not just for experienced developers but also welcomes beginners,
turning coding challenges into more engaging, collaborative, and effective
learning sessions.
